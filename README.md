Please read the following instructions to better utilize the repository. 

A. All data are downloaded from the website https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s, and stored in the repository folder called “raw data”.


B. From the available raw data sets, we developed two types of data sets called “Dataxxxx_Part1” and “Dataxxxx_Part2”. These two data sets are obtained from yearly raw datasets using the yearly R code stored in folder “code”. Part 1 data is the manipulated data sets which contains the geographical information we needed for our functions, and part 2 data is the scaled version by 100000 inhabitants.


C. Files named “alldata_Part1” and “alldata_part2” are the combined version of part 1 and part 2 data from each year, and are also the datasets used in functions.


D. The tutorials of 3 functions are stored in folder “report”, and function codes are in folder “code”.


E. In summary, all the datasets are in folder “raw data”; all the codes are in folder “code”; all the report related documents (except the report itself) are in folder “report”.
